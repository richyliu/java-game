The order of operations are:
    1. parenthesis ()
    2. exponents ^
    3. multiplication and division *, /
    4. addition and subtraction +, -
An easy way to remember the order of operations is by remembering PEMDAS
For levels 1-10, calculate the correct answer by clicking on the
operations (+, -, *, or /) in order
For levels 11-20, drag operations from the black boxes to the blue boxes
to make the "current answer" match "expected answer"
